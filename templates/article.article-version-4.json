        "description": "<p>I was introduced to this <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"#\">California-based cultivator<\/a> by one of the founders of <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"#\">Rose<\/a>, who uses <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"#\">Royal Key<\/a> flower for some of their Delights. Yesterday evening, I helped myself to a couple hits of one of their <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"#\">pre-rolls<\/a> before heading out on a sunset stroll and I’m here to share the good news: Royal Key’s Riddles is the goldilocks of weed strains. It’s elevating but not anxiety inducing, relaxing without leaving you sluggish, and offers the kind of potent but clear-as-a-bell high I dream about. Later that evening, I found myself singing along to <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"#\">Zach Bryan’s<\/a> rendition of <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"#\">“You Are My Sunshine”<\/a> while tending to a pot of Amatriciana sauce (reply to this email if you want the recipe), and as far as I’m concerned, that song could have been written about Riddles. —VvP<\/p>"
